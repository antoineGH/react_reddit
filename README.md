# react_reddit

For this project, we will be using the Reddit JSON API. There is no maintained documentation but the API is simple enough to use. We will provide you with some pointers on how to use it.

Reddit is a website where people share links to articles, media and other things on the web. The Reddit API provides data which you will integrate into your application. The application will allow users to view and search posts and comments provided by the API.
